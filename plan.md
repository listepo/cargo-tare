# cargo-tare

https://github.com/listepo/cargo-tare

A cargo subcommand that shrinks live `target/` directories without slowing builds: transparent
APFS compression, copy-on-write dedupe across targets, clone-seeding of new worktrees, and opt-in
removal of orphaned or idle targets — planned together so the approaches reinforce each other.
Design in `DESIGN.md`, measurements in `docs/research.md`.

Blockers: none. Everything is free to start: the engine (`src/engine.rs`), the inode model
(`src/model.rs`), the inventory with families (`src/inventory.rs`), the hash index
(`src/index.rs`) and the test harness with the freshness oracle (`tests/common/mod.rs`) exist.
T13–T18 were added from the competitor review in `docs/research.md`; each card says which tool
does the same thing today.

### T21. Windows: NTFS compression and ReFS block cloning

Compression: NTFS has per-file transparent compression through `FSCTL_SET_COMPRESSION`, and the
allocated size to measure it with comes from `GetCompressedFileSize`. Dedupe: ReFS has block
cloning (`FSCTL_DUPLICATE_EXTENTS_TO_FILE`); NTFS has no copy-on-write at all, so dedupe there is
T22's hardlink fallback, which now exists and needs only `caps` to answer honestly there. File identity is `GetFileInformationByHandle`'s volume serial plus file index,
and the build lock stays `File::try_lock`, which is already cross-platform.

`windows-sys` is approved by the creator for this task; it lands in `toolchain.md` and
`rust.md` in the same change that wires it. Done: the pass suite
runs on ReFS, NTFS reports no block sharing and falls back to T22 instead of failing, and paths
with drive letters and `\\?\` prefixes are covered by tests.
